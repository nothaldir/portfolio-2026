      Hi there 👋,
      <br />
      I'm Alex, a Front-End Engineer based in Paris, France.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like working with modern JavaScript and TypeScript tools: Vue, Nuxt, Next and Supabase are
      just a few of them.
      <br />
      Through my work, I try to have a positive impact on both the people I work with and those who
      use what I build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to know a bit more?
      <br />

    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
