      Welcome,
      <br />
      I'm Alex, a Front-End Engineer based in Paris, France.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like working with modern JavaScript and TypeScript tools: Vue, Nuxt, React, Next, Supabase
      and many more.
      <br />
      Through my work, I try to have a positive impact on both the people I work with and those who
      use what I build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to know a bit more?
